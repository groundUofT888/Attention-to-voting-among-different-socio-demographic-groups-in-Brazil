# Discussion

## Findings


## Ethical Implications
  
  The datasets and original sources used in their paper come from Brazil demographic censuses and Brazil school census. Demography refers to summarizing the demographic characteristics of a community, such as gender, age, race, education level, socioeconomic status, etc. Ethical issues may arise if used improperly during the collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of demographic data. Demographics impact minority communities, which can lead to structural inequalities. When analyzing demographic variables, the author selected specific variables for analysis based on his research questions and hypotheses. However, these highly characteristic data will have a negative impact on some social groups. For example, high income, low income, dropout rate, etc. This may reinforce social hierarchies in which social groups are compared, exacerbating prejudice and stereotypes and causing harm to minority populations. In the paper, the author compares the interest of high-income people and low-income people in voting. This may cause certain social conflicts and encourage the idea of inequality among different groups. When explaining differences between social groups in the conclusion of the author's paper, it can lead to increased social conflict.
  

## Accounting for Bias

In the paper, Moya Chin proposes a stylized model that explores the motivations of politicians to appeal to a wider range of voters in elections and to provide public goods in different ways. The author uses this model to observe the Economic Consequences of Electoral Rules in Brazil. The data used by the author mainly comes from Brazil demographic censuses, Brazil school Census, and Brazil municipal election data. Bias can occur when collecting quantitative and qualitative data. The problem with these data sets and original sources is that the variables used by the authors to construct the equipment index come from the Brazilian School Census and the Brazilian demographic censuses. Considering Brazil's national conditions and the government's influence on the region, Response Bias may exist in the data set of Brazil demographic censuses. Census respondents may choose not to participate in the census or provide inaccurate information because of privacy concerns or distrust of the government. The school census data comes from students in schools. Considering the lack of educational resources in poor areas of Brazil, there will be a sampling frame bias. The earliest census data used by the author is from 1980. At that time, in some remote or poor areas, it may be more difficult for enumerators to reach or collect data due to lack of infrastructure and information technology. This may lead to underestimation or inaccurate population data in these areas, and the sample may not be representative of the characteristics of the entire population.
