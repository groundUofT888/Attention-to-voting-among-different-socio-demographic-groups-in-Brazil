# Voting Patterns and Socio-Economic Tides: A Twenty-Year Analysis of Brazil's Developmental Dynamics

## Overview
This repo features a reproduction of Moya Chin's paper, When Do Politicians Appeal Broadly? The Economic Consequences of Electoral Rules in Brazil, containing data, R scripts, and a final PDF report . This analysis furthered the original paper's discussion of investigating the impact of Brazil's electoral rules on politicians' strategies and public goods distribution, particularly focusing on education outcomes. It contrasts single-round and two-round systems, revealing that two-round elections lead to broader geographic voter support and more equitable public services.

A replication using the Social Science Reproduction Platform was also produced: https://doi.org/10.48152/ssrp-qxvj-fz21
